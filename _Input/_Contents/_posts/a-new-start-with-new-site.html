So, it has been more than 10 years since I am attached with linux. I have to say that it has been a very interesting journey. Back at the begining, I was obviously a noob(still is 😔️) with everything and all of the tools I came up with was intimidating. But I was trying hard to cope with the systems.
There were a lot of trials and errors. Though it has been some years, I still feels like I should make something from the scratch. And here it is.

<pre>
<code>
paker = **pa**+**ker**
paker = **Pa**ge Ma**ker**
</code>
</pre>

I have committed this tool to github, <strong>__Paker-1.0.1__</strong>.
Hold on. I haven't said about the role of this tool. What it does is -
> Take markdown file and make it html.

That is it. But, with some theming and other structure as some additions to make them usable as a website, <strong>**static website</strong>.

I will explain on another post about its making. Bye for now.
