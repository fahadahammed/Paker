<p>So, Cloud flare has a lot of options to provide. I personally and professionally been with them for a while.  It has been a great journey. Recently, I was thinking about trying out their workers. I did today and it seems very very promising. The documentation was also good. __wrangler__ is a nice idea and implementation. I wanted to try the concept and end up with static one.<p>

If you hit here <a href="https://ip.tech0.xyz" target="_blank">https://ip.tech0.xyz</a> you will see your ip address. Pretty simple. It is running via **workers**.

<pre><code class="bash">
$ curl -I https://ip.tech0.xyz
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="bash">
HTTP/2 200

</code></pre>

<p>
But the problem is, I wanted to try **key-value(KV)** store of __Cloudflares__. But I am on zero luck as they do not provide it for **free**. It is costly from my points of view. $5/month.
However, I will give it a try when I will have some plans for my company. By the way, it is fast but it has limited calls. So if you try to flood that address, I will end up with error on serving.
